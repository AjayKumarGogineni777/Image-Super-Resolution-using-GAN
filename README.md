# Image-Super-Resolution-using-GAN

We have Satellite Images of 5-4-3 Composite band. One folder contains images with clods and the other without clouds. We try to take
an image with clouds and make them as close as possible to those without clouds using GAN and feature loss.
U-Net is used as a generator.
